Touhou Discord Programmer Challenge #1 [Easy]:

Implement an algorithm that can calculate the Knuth up arrow values for a
particular set of inputs:

```
knuth(2, 3, 1) = 2 ^ 3 = 8
knuth(2, 3, 2) = 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = <some obscenely large power of
2>
```

This does not need to pragmatically run, just write the algorithm assuming that
the numbers can get arbitrarily large.
